This is an excellent breakdown! I particularly appreciate the nuances you've included, such as the focus on error analysis and accessibility for undergraduate students.  The option to specify the citation style is also a huge time-saver.

I'm going to choose **Option 3** and further refine it to match the project I have in mind. Here's the filled-out version:

>Compile a list of academic references and resources that would be helpful in **designing an experiment to investigate Newton's Laws of Motion, with a particular focus on minimizing experimental error.** The experiment will involve **measuring the acceleration of a system of two masses connected by a string over a pulley (Atwood's machine) to verify Newton's Second Law, considering friction in the pulley and air resistance.**  Please include:
>
>*   References on **error analysis** and **uncertainty calculations** relevant to kinematic measurements (position, velocity, acceleration) and mass measurements.
>*   Sources discussing **best practices for experimental setup** and data acquisition for Atwood's machine, including techniques for measuring or estimating friction in the pulley.
>*   Articles that discuss common **sources of error** in Atwood's machine experiments, such as pulley friction, string mass, and air resistance, and how to mitigate them.
>*   References for **calibration techniques** of equipment, like motion detectors (e.g., photogates, ultrasonic motion sensors) and mass balances.
>*   **Mathematical models** for Atwood's machine that include friction and air resistance.
>
>Please format the references in **APA style**.
